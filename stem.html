                <h2>eSMART Summer Camp 2017: June 26-30
</h2>
                <p>eSMART (exploring Science, Math and Related technologies) is a Summer Camp for Girls started by the St. George, Utah chapter of the American Association of University Women to encourage our girls to reach high and love to learn so they can be anything they want to be. Dixie State University is a partner and hosts the camps.</p>
                <p>Camp includes several STEM workshops taught by successful women with STEM careers. It's a time for girls from other schools get know each other, learn to work together, interview STEM career women and spend time with women college STEM students.</p>
                <p>Girls from Washington, Kane and Iron counties are eligible for fee waivers to the five-day, four-night, camp that includes a day tour of Zion National Park guided by teachers of botany, geology and the ecosystem. The teaching staff and counselors are all experienced in their fields, many having staffed the camp for years.</p>
                <p>The total cost of the camp per girl is $500 and covers meals, rooming in DSU dormitories and the trip to Zion National Park. Because of funds raised during the Fashion Show, parents are only asked to provide a small portion of this expense, $150, and financial assistance is available to help with that fee. Registration, including request for fee waiver, will be available online soon.</p> 
                <p>The 2017 eSMART Camp will be one, 5 day-4 night session in the dorms of DSU from June 26-June 30 and can accommodate up to 80 girls. Registration is now open.  </p>

                <h2>TechSavvy: Middle School Girls Meet STEM
</h2>
                <p>TechSavvy Southern Utah is a daylong science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) career conference designed to get 6th-9th grade girls excited about careers in these fields and to help families learn how to help their daughters achieve their STEM education and career goals.</p>
                <p>Last year we had more than 100 girls and 30 parents attend this daylong conference. Space is limited to sign up early! The cost of the conference includes a light snack for breakfast, lunch, t-shirt and all the workshop materials. There is also a drawing at the end of the day with lots of cool science and technology prizes.</p>
                <p>Needs-Based Waivers are available for girls who may not otherwise be able to afford the cost to attend TechSavvy. If you know of a girl or have questions please contact Rachel Ramsay at 435.879.4348 or TechSavvy@aauw-stgeorge.org.
                <p>In order to keep the costs low we are dependent on the support of area businesses and individuals who are willing to donate money and in-kind materials. Any amount helps provide this unique opportunity to as many girls as possible. Donations are tax deductible. <a href="https://ww2.aauw.org/program-gift/?treatment=TECHSAVVY">Donate online </a>or contact Rachel Ramsay. The TechSavvy Program is made possible by a grant from the national American Association of University Women and support from Dixie State University.</p>
