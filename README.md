Prototype for redesign of the St. George Branch of AAUW website. 


This site for the St. George Branch of AAUW is being streamlined from a WordPress format where all former posts are available and navigation changes with the season, to a consistent, streamlined structure with current content. The site is fully responsive, with mobile navigation viewable via a hamburger icon. The full transition is in process, but you can get a sneak peak.
